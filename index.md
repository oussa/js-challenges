# js-challenges

A bunch of challenges to get familiar with the use of Javascript in an HTML page.

Each of the challenges has a solution included, but try to solve it on your own and to google the stuff you don't know or understand before jumping to the solution.

Also keep room for your imagination! You don't have to stick 100% to the content of the challenge, the design or the actions, as the main purpose is to learn :)
